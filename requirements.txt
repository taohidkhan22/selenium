Here is a sample `requirements.txt` file based on the tools you're likely using in a Selenium project:

```plaintext
selenium==4.11.2
pytest==7.4.0
requests==2.31.0
```

### Instructions:
1. Copy this content into a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory.
2. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

If you need additional dependencies or versions tailored to your project, let me know!
